Node.js Express Framework Overview for Rocket Elevators
Introduction
Welcome to the documentation that outlines the rationale behind choosing the Node.js Express framework for the Rocket Elevators project. 
In this document, we'll provide a business-oriented explanation of what Node.js and the Express framework are, and why they are the most efficient choices for our project.

What is Node.js?
Node.js is a powerful, open-source, server-side JavaScript runtime environment that allows developers to build scalable and high-performance applications. 
Unlike traditional server-side languages, Node.js is event-driven and non-blocking, making it particularly suitable for real-time applications, such as web servers and APIs.

Key Features of Node.js:
JavaScript on the Server: Utilizes JavaScript, a language commonly associated with web browsers, for server-side development.
Event-Driven and Non-Blocking: Efficiently handles concurrent operations without waiting for one to complete before starting another.
V8 JavaScript Engine: Leverages the same high-performance engine that powers Google Chrome, providing rapid execution of code.
What is Express?
Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features to develop web and mobile applications. 
It simplifies the process of building scalable and modular web applications by providing a straightforward set of tools and conventions.

Key Features of Express:
Routing: Defines how an application responds to client requests at specific endpoints, making it easy to organize and structure the application.
Middleware: Allows for the inclusion of additional functionality in the request-response cycle, enhancing the capabilities of the application.
Extensibility: Supports the use of numerous plugins and middleware to easily integrate additional features.
Why Node.js Express for Rocket Elevators?
1. Speed and Scalability:
Node.js, with its non-blocking, event-driven architecture, ensures high-speed performance, making it an ideal choice for a project like Rocket Elevators,
which demands real-time updates and efficient handling of multiple requests simultaneously.

3. JavaScript Unification:
Utilizing Node.js on the server and client-side allows for a unified JavaScript codebase. This streamlines development,
reduces context-switching for developers, and enhances code maintainability.

5. Robust Framework with Express:
Express provides a lightweight yet powerful framework for building web applications. Its simplicity and flexibility align with our development goals,
allowing us to create a scalable and maintainable solution for Rocket Elevators.

In conclusion, the combination of Node.js and Express offers an efficient, scalable, 
and unified development environment that aligns perfectly with the goals and requirements of the Rocket Elevators project. This choice not only ensures optimal 
performance but also facilitates a streamlined and cohesive development process.
